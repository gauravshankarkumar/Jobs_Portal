# Jobs_Portal
In this job portal, the applicants and companies can register themselves. Both are provided with different roles. The applicant can see a list of jobs available and can apply to any that matches his/her skill set. Similarly, the companies can add new jobs and select the applicants who have applied for that job by seeing their resume.
